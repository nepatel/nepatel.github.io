      Hello digital nomad.
    </p>

    <p>
      The voice in your head is now me. Isn't that a hoot?
      <br />
      Both it and I can be considered to be One.
      <br />
      Then, would you and I be One in this moment?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Apologies for intruding on your thoughts! I find this quite creepy, as
      well.
      <br />
      One last question: do I sound like you, me, or someone else?
    </p>

    <p>
      Enough pandering.
    </p>
