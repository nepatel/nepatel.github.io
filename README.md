## Hello digital nomad.

I see you are interested in my life - perhaps personal, perhaps professional.

(Un)fortunately we are more connected than we often realize.

My splash page will blur the line between the idea of __me__ and __you__.
Thus, I will refer to the following pages in the __first-person plural__.

### Neil B Patel
Our **/home** page will give you a TLDR version of my resume.
Maybe you are a recruiter for a program that teaches penguins to code?
Scroll to the bottom and you'll find a little easter egg (hint: my resume).

### Our Work
Our **/work** page will give you my portfolio.
The catch here is that the project descriptions are written in pseudocode / joke code.
Not sure where to start? My favorite projects are **SiegeQR**, **wtfAnime**, and **The Crimelog**.


### About Us
Our **/about** page will give you an ethical statement on the state of technology and people.
If you are a developer, designer, engineer, or computer scientist, I highly encourage you to check this out.
When we're just sitting behind a keyboard and terminal, it's easy to forget that we have incredible digital power to shape the world, society, and people's lives.
